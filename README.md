# Showtimes Backend

This repository contains the code for the backend API that are used on the bot and also the WebUI.

The reason this was made is as an improvement to the current system and also as my final year project since naoTimes always started as a solo project by @noaione

## Why?
I created this project back in 2019 as Indonesian equivalent version of existing or similar project. I don't see their code, I only do what I think looks correct and now I'm basically botching together my bot and WebUI which honestly, a really bad design.

This project mainly aims to decouple the Showtimes module from the Bot to it's own thing, complete with more "big data" stuff like performance analytics and more! This is only a backend part of the project which only contains the API code made using GraphQL. See the [WebUI](https://github.com/noaione/naoTimesUI) implementations or the [Discord Bot](https://github.com/naoTimesdev/naoTimes) for a "frontend" view of it.
